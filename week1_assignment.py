#SOLVE THESE QUESTIONS AND SPECIFY RUNNING TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY IN COMMENTS.

#Question 1:

#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#Example: [2,3,4,2,7] target = 10, output = [1,4]

def twoSum(nums, target):
    #your code goes here
    pass

#Time and space complexity:

#Question 2:
#Given some arrays with strings on them, find the most common longest prefix among them.
#Example: ["flower","flow","flight"] output = "fl"

def findMostCommonPrefix(arr):
    #your code goes here
    pass

#Time and space complexity:

#Question 3:
#Given an array of integers, return the indices of three numbers that add up to 0.
#example: [1, 2, -2, -1, 3] output = [2, 3, 4]

def threeSum(nums):
    #your code goes here
    pass

#Time and space complexity:

#Question 4:
#Given a singly linked list, reverse the nodes of the linked list
#Example 1: [1, 2, 3] output = [3, 2, 1]

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

def printList(head):
    while head:
        print(head.data)
        head = head.next

head = Node(1)
middle = Node(2)
tail = Node(3)

head.next = middle
middle.next = tail
tail.next = None

printList(head)

def reverseList(head):
    #your code goes here
    pass
